# SnapWild Project

## Overview
SnapWild is an animal recognition application that utilizes machine learning to identify various animal species from images. The project is structured into two main components: a backend that handles model training and serving, and a frontend that provides a user interface for interaction.

## Backend
- **train.py**: Contains the code for training the animal recognition model, including data preprocessing and model saving.
- **app.py**: Main application file that sets up the web server or API to serve the trained model and handle requests.
- **model.py**: Defines the architecture of the animal recognition model and methods for loading and using the model for predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the backend, such as machine learning libraries and web frameworks.

## Frontend
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the frontend application, containing the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css**: CSS styles for the frontend application, defining the visual appearance of the web page.
- **script.js**: JavaScript code for the frontend application, handling user interactions and making requests to the backend.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snapwild
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model**:
   ```
   python backend/train.py
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   python backend/app.py
   ```

5. **Access the frontend**:
   Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser to interact with the application.

## Usage
- Upload images of animals to the frontend to receive predictions from the trained model.
- Explore the application features and functionalities as designed in the frontend.
